# Ivysis
To build a personal AI secretary who understands you and works for you proactively and confidentially.

## Overview
Ivysis is an open-source project aimed to create a personal AI secretary (called Ivy) who assists you seamlessly across your personal and professional life, just like a real human-secretary.

Ivy proactively organizes, notifies and reminds you about the tasks or updates in your professional and personal life. She understands you so well that she only delivers what you need to know.

More importantly, Ivy runs totally on your machine to ensure privacy, so you can feel free to chat with Ivy for anything.
